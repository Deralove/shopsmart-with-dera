### **Files and Functionality**

The project is built entirely in a single HTML file, `index.html`, which contains all the necessary code for the website. Here's a breakdown:

1. **HTML**: This is the foundation of the website, structuring all its content. The file includes the layout for product listings, the sticky donation button, and navigation elements.
2. **CSS**: The styling for the site is included directly in the `index.html` file. The CSS defines the vibrant pink theme and gives the website its aesthetic appearance.
3. **JavaScript**: Embedded JavaScript adds interactivity, like making the donation button sticky and ensuring smooth user interaction.
4. **Images**: All images used on the website are linked via external URLs, which eliminates the need for an image folder and keeps the project lightweight.

### **Design Choices**

1. **Single-File Structure**
   I decided to include all code in one file to make the project easy to manage and deploy. While this might not be the best practice for larger projects, it works well for this small and straightforward website.

2. **Sticky Donation Button**
   The sticky donation button was added to keep it always visible to users. This encourages contributions while they explore the site. Placing it in a prominent location ensures that it doesn’t get overlooked.

3. **Pink Theme**
   The website's bright pink color scheme was chosen to make it stand out and feel inviting. It adds a fun and modern touch, creating an enjoyable browsing experience for users.

4. **Responsive Design**
   Although the site is simple, I ensured that it adjusts well to different screen sizes. This makes the website accessible and user-friendly across various devices.

### **Challenges and Solutions**

1. **Deployment Issues**
   One of the biggest challenges I faced was deploying the website. After deploying it, I kept encountering a **404 error**. I tried several fixes but couldn’t figure out the issue for a while. Eventually, I realized that the problem was due to my GitHub repository structure. The `index.html` file was inside a folder, which caused the error. Once I moved it to the root of the repository, the issue was resolved.

2. **Combining CSS and JavaScript**
   Since all the code was in one file, it was initially difficult to keep things organized. To fix this, I used clear comments and proper formatting to make the code easier to read and maintain.

3. **Creating an Aesthetic Design**
   Balancing functionality with an attractive design was challenging. I tested different layouts and shades of pink to achieve a look that was both eye-catching and not too overwhelming.

### **Technologies Used**

1. **Frontend**
   - HTML: Used to structure the website.
   - CSS: Used to style the site and create the pink, aesthetic theme.
   - JavaScript: Used for interactivity, like the sticky donation button.

2. **Hosting**
   - Vercel: The hosting platform where I deployed my website.

### **Future Improvements**

- **Separate Files**: I plan to separate the CSS and JavaScript into their own files for better organization and maintainability.
- **Search Feature**: Adding a search bar would make it easier for users to find products.
- **Additional Pages**: I would like to create dedicated pages for categories, user reviews, and donations to make the site more functional and comprehensive.
- **Enhanced Donation System**: I want to expand the donation feature by including multiple payment methods and detailed descriptions of causes.
